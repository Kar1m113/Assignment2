        <p>the highest number of Asylum Seekers that left that country.</p>
        <p>Looking at the map, it can be seen that the</p>
        <p>countries with the most refugees leaving is</p>
        <p>Cuba, Guatemala and Honduras, with the total number of refugees</p>
        <p>leaving are 1687480, 1571130 and 1287800 respectively.</p>
        <p>This data illustrates the ethnicities of most refugees are</p>

            <p>The Choropleth map above is showing the distribution of </p>
        <p>refugees amongst the countries that they flee to.</p>
        <p>The map shows that the highest number of Asylum Seekers</p>

        <p>The number of Asylum Seekers leaving these countries are</p>
        <p>223450, 180380 and 109690 respectively.</p>
        <p>This data presents that refugees are seeking refuge in countries</p>
        <p>that are near by their home due to the</p>
        <p>lack of quality of life, caused by wars or poverty.</p>

            <p>The line chart to the left is a timeline from</p>
            <p>2012 to 2022, showing the number of refugees that</p>
            <p>entered a country each year.</p>
            <p>The 5 countries that were used for the line chart are</p>
            <p>Australia, Malaysia, United States of America, Great Britain and Netherlands.</p>
            <p>The visualisation shows that all countries are having increasing number</p>
            <p>of refugees entering their countries. Especially for european countries,</p>
            <p>Great Britain has had a 140% in total number of</p>
            <p>refugees entering from 2021 to 2022. Also, the Netherlands has</p>
            <p>increased by 119% of its total number of refugees in 2021.</p>
            <p>This behaviour can also be seen in the USA,</p>
            <p>where its total increased by 7%.</p>
            <p>However, this drastic increase does not apply to Australia and </p>
            <p>Malaysia. The total number of refugees in these countries</p>
            <p>has plateaued in recent years.</p>

            <p><h6>Figure 4 - Bar Chart</h6></p>
            <p>Looking at the bar chart, it can be seen that</p>
        <p>most refugees have an income that is between $650-$999.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the distribution along the bar chart is almost symmetrical</p>
        <p>This means that most refugees living in Australia are</p>
        <p>earning around $1,000, which is below the weekly income</p>
        <p>average of $1,400.</p>

            <p id="Occupation">Data..</p>
            <p><h6>Figure 5 - Stacked Bar Chart</h6></p>
            <p>The Stacked Bar Chart illustrates the number of refugees in</p>
            <p>certain occupations, for both male and female refugees</p>
            <p>From the visualisation, there are certain occupations where</p>
            <p>it is majority of males with that occupation or females.</p>
            <p>This can be seen for Automotive Trade Workers,</p>
            <p>where only 363 females have that occupation compared to</p>
            <p>27,890 males. This gives a ratio of 1 female: 77 males</p>
            <p>This distribution can be seen in other occupations such as</p>
            <p>Construction workers and Rail/Road Drivers.</p>
            <p>However, females are dominating other occupations such as</p>
            <p>Carers, Professional Educators and Health Professionals</p>
